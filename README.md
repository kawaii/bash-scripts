# bash-scripts
Random assortment of useful scripts to automate various tasks on Linux servers, ZSH compatible.

I am currently doing a lot of experimentation and learning with shell scripting, as I have an interest in automation. If you have any suggestions for something that can potentially be automated with a shell script please feel free to open a GitHub issue and propose your idea. :)

Thanks to [Ian Carrol](https://github.com/iangcarroll) and [Josh Harmon](https://github.com/JoshHarmon) for some helpful suggestions and fixes!
